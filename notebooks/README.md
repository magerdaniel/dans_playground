# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration and experimentation.

## Purpose

Notebooks are ideal for:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Testing API connections
- Prototyping AI models
- Documenting experiments
- Learning new concepts interactively

## Notebook Categories

### Data Exploration
- Connecting to data sources
- Understanding data structures
- Basic analytics

### AI/ML Experiments
- Testing LLM prompts
- Training small models
- Evaluating results

### Integration Tests
- BI API interactions
- Database connectivity
- End-to-end workflows

## Best Practices

1. **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names like `01_connect_to_tableau.ipynb`
2. **Add markdown**: Document your thought process
3. **Include outputs**: Save notebook outputs for reference
4. **Version control**: Commit notebooks with cleared outputs when sensitive

## Getting Started

To use notebooks:
```bash
pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

Or use VS Code with the Jupyter extension.
