# Dan's AI on BI Playground

A personal training repository for learning and experimenting with building AI applications on top of Business Intelligence (BI) repositories and systems.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a hands-on learning environment to explore:
- Integration of AI/ML models with BI data sources
- Natural language querying of business data
- Automated insights generation from BI repositories
- AI-powered data visualization and reporting
- Machine learning pipelines for business analytics
